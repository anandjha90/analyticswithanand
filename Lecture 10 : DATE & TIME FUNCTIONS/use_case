/*
Snowflake provides a rich set of date and time functions that allow you to perform various operations on date, time, and timestamp data types. Here are different use cases demonstrating common datetime functions in Snowflake:
*/

-- GET CURRENT DATE
SELECT CURRENT_DATE;

-- GET CURRENT TIME
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

-- GET CURRENT DATE
SELECT CURRENT_TIME;

--1. Extracting Components of Date and Time
--Use Case: Extract specific parts (e.g., year, month, day) from a date or timestamp.

-- Extract Year, Month, Day from a Date
SELECT 
    YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) AS year, 
    MONTH(CURRENT_DATE) AS month, 
    DAY(CURRENT_DATE) AS day;
    
--2. Date Arithmetic
---Use Case: Add or subtract intervals from a date or timestamp.
-- Add 10 days to the current date
SELECT CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '10 DAY' AS future_date; 
SELECT CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 MONTH' AS PAST_MONTH;

-- Subtract 2 months from the current date
SELECT DATEADD(MONTH, -2, CURRENT_DATE) AS past_date;

--3. Date Difference
--Use Case: Calculate the difference between two dates or timestamps.

-- Difference in days between two dates
SELECT DATEDIFF(DAY, '2024-01-01', CURRENT_DATE) AS days_diff;

-- Difference in months between two dates
SELECT DATEDIFF(MONTH, '2023-01-01', CURRENT_DATE) AS months_diff;

--4. Formatting Dates
--Use Case: Convert a date into a specific format string.

-- Format date as 'DD/MM/YYYY'
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, '') AS formatted_date;
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'DD-MM-YYYY') AS formatted_date;
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'DD/MM/YYYY') AS formatted_date;
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'MM/DD/YYYY') AS formatted_date;
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'MM-DD-YYYY') AS formatted_date;
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'YYYY-MM') AS formatted_date;
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'MM-DD-YY') AS formatted_date;

-- Format timestamp with hour, minute, and second
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') AS formatted_timestamp;

--Truncating Date/Time
--Use Case: Truncate date/time to a specified precision (e.g., hour, day, month).

-- Truncate to start of the month
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', CURRENT_DATE) AS month_start;

-- Truncate to start of the hour
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('HOUR', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AS hour_start;

--6. Handling Time Zones
--Use Case: Convert timestamps between time zones.
-- Convert current timestamp to 'America/New_York' timezone
SELECT CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', 'America/New_York', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AS est_time;

-- Convert from one timezone to another
SELECT CONVERT_TIMEZONE('America/Los_Angeles', 'Europe/London', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AS london_time;

--7. Extracting Week Information
--Use Case: Get the week number or weekday from a date.
-- Get the week number of the year
SELECT WEEK(CURRENT_DATE) AS week_number;

-- Get the day of the week (0 = Sunday, 6 = Saturday)
SELECT DAYOFWEEK(CURRENT_DATE) AS day_of_week;

--8. Creating Date/Time Values
--Use Case: Create date or time values from components.
-- Create a date from year, month, and day
SELECT DATE_FROM_PARTS(2024, 9, 8) AS custom_date;

-- Create a timestamp from components
SELECT TIMESTAMP_FROM_PARTS(2024, 9, 8, 12, 30, 45) AS custom_timestamp;

--9. Working with Epoch Time
--Use Case: Convert between epoch time and a human-readable date.
-- Convert epoch time (seconds since 1970-01-01) to timestamp
SELECT TO_TIMESTAMP(1627764000) AS readable_timestamp;

-- Convert a timestamp to epoch seconds
SELECT EXTRACT(EPOCH_SECOND FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AS epoch_time;

--10. Adjusting Dates for Business Days
--Use Case: Add business days (excluding weekends) to a date.
-- Add 10 business days to the current date

SELECT DATEADD('day', 10, CURRENT_DATE) AS future_business_day;

--11. Comparing Timestamps
--Use Case: Compare two timestamps and find the difference in hours, minutes, etc.

-- Difference in hours between two timestamps
SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, '2024-09-01 12:00:00', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) AS hours_diff;


-- USE CASE PRACTICE
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,                  -- Unique identifier for each order

    order_date DATE,                           -- Date when the order was placed

-- Extracting Part of a Timestamp for Filtering
-- Use Case: Use EXTRACT to filter records based on specific parts of a timestamp.
-- Get all records created in 2024
SELECT *

-- Get all records created in September, regardless of the year
SELECT *
